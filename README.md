# Classes
### OOP Object Oriented Programming
## There are 4 pillars
- Inheritance
  - **Eliminates redundant code**
  - use all functions and variables from parent class

- Encapsulation
  - **Reduce complexity and increase reusability**

- Abstraction
  - **reduce complexity and isolate impact of changes**

- Polymorphism
  - **Refactor code or case statements**

-What are classes
 - classes are a way to bring data and functionality together
-why
  - Class is the main factor that is used to implement any of these pillars

- Syntax: class name_of_class starting with Capital letter
- Good naming convention is required
e.g 
```python
class Dog:
    # defining class variable
    animal_kind = "canine"
    
    # self refers to current class
    def bark(self):
        return "woof"
```
